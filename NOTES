Read a file of cross-references, on xref per line. -f FILE
Allow different delimiters -d DELIM
default is comma? or space?

Act as filter, from stdin or file(s) to stdout.

xref will be a hash of /regex/ => subregex
                    or 'string literal' => subliteral
string literal might be a nice default, with regex a flag -r
(how easy to implement literal?)

how do we prevent collisions? (Are collisions ever right?)
noclobber flag - don't use if you know there are no collisions,
to avoid the waste - otherwise to we need a tmp value?
