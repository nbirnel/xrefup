.SH BUGS
Collisions are not prevented or warned of.
There is no provision for making part of the data "safe" \(em
it is wisest to run this on a cleansed portion of data if you
expect free\(hyform text to be part of the data.
It's slow. 
(Running under Cygwin on Windows 7 with 2.93 GHz processor and 6GB memory,
25K replacments from a 10K xref list took 7m40.356s real time.)
Probably others.
